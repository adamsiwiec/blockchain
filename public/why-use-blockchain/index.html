Blockchains do this too, but they also maintain a record of all the information that existed before. It’s a database with history, if you like.</p></li><li><p><strong>There’s no one, central point of attack.</strong> The fact that blockchain is a decentralised way of storing and accessing data makes the whole system incredibly secure – because, unlike a centralised database, there’s no one single point of entry for hackers. This makes it particularly useful for recording transactions in a secure manner.</p></li><li><p><strong>And no centralised control.</strong> Because the system of record is decentralised and replicated in its entirety in multiple places, there’s no need for a central administrator and all the costs and infrastructure that comes with it.</p></li></ul><p>These principles lead to making systems that run with blockchain hard to hijack, but at the same time, provide open access for anyone to verify other’s transactions. It is similar to how you can see people’s Venmo transactions with someone else but not see how much they are sending, or how much is in their bank account. To continue this analogy, if someone sent someone money on Venmo, other users would have to reach a consensus of whether this is an actual transaction, then once verified, propagate the transaction to all of the two people’s friends.</p><p>Here are some more cases of when blockchain might come in handy from <a href="https://www.bernardmarr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bernard Marr</a>:</p><ul><li><p><strong>When you want to manage and secure digital relationships or keep a decentralised, shared system of record.</strong> Anytime you want to keep a long-term, transparent record of assets (for example, to record property or land rights), blockchain could be the ideal solution. ‘Smart contracts’, in particular, are great for facilitating digital relationships and transactions. With a smart contract, automated payments can be released when parties in a transaction agree that their conditions have been met.</p></li><li><p><strong>Anywhere a middleman or gatekeeper function is expensive or time-consuming.</strong> For example, most accommodation providers currently have to interact with guests via a centralised aggregator platform, like Airbnb or Expedia (who, in turn, take a cut on each booking). Blockchain could change all that. For example, travel company TUI is so convinced of the power of blockchain, it’s pioneering ways to connect hoteliers and customers directly, so that they can transact via blockchain in an easy, safe and consistent way, rather than via a central booking platform.</p></li><li><p><strong>When you want to record secure transactions, especially between multiple partners.</strong> A traditional database may be good for recording simple transactions between two parties, but when things get more complicated, blockchain can reduce bottlenecks and simplify relationships. For example, shipping conglomerate Maersk is working with IBM to develop a private blockchain platform to connect its various partners and customers across the shipping industry. What’s more, the added security of a decentralized system makes blockchain ideal for transactions in general.</p></li><li><p><strong>Where the data is in constant flux, but you want to keep a record of past actions.</strong> Blockchain is a better, safer way to record activity and keep data fresh, while maintaining a record of its history. The data can’t be corrupted by anyone or accidentally deleted, and you benefit from both a historical trail of data, plus an instantly up-to-date record.</p></li></ul><h1 id="So-when-should-you-not-use-blockchain"><a href="#So-when-should-you-not-use-blockchain" class="headerlink" title="So when should you not use blockchain?"></a>So when should you not use blockchain?</h1><p>Blockchain shouldn’t be used for strictly confidential information. For example, a franchise could have a blockchain for all the sales at different restaurants, but you wouldn’t want a franchise restaurant looking at the other restaurant down the street’s sales. However, you can have a closed blockchain. So with the same analogy, the company could allow only franchise stores to see each other’s sales, but not the general public.</p><p>Also, since consensus needs to be reached for a transaction to be executed, high-speed transactions might not be the best fit. For example, a Bitcoin transaction takes about 10 minutes to fully send. However, companies like Libra are creating new forms of blockchain that can handle over 100,000 transactions per second!</p></div></article></div></main><footer><div class="paginator"><a class="prev" href="../introduction/">PREV</a><a class="next" href="../smart-contracts/">NEXT</a></div><div class="copyright"><p>Made with ♡ by the CS 58N class at Stanford</p><p>© 2020 Adam Siwiec and Co.</p></div></footer></div><script async src="//cdn.bootcss.com/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML" integrity="sha384-crwIf/BuaWM9rM65iM+dWFldgQ1Un8jWZMuh3puxb8TOY9+linwLoI7ZHZT+aekW" crossorigin="anonymous"></script></body></html>
