Imagine a society in which a reliable form of transactions is common, a society where people can trust others without the need of any intermediary. If you imagine such a thing as a novel invention, then imagine a world of ‘blockchain’.<br>It has been almost a decade since blockchain has become a buzzword for computer science. Though still in its preliminary and experimental stage, blockchain promises a future world where political, economic, and financial institutions will be revolutionized. Our daily lives would transform on an unforeseen scale, and because of this magnitude it is pertinent that we have a great understanding of blockchains underlying principles.<br>In this website, we would like to introduce you to the basic overview of blockchain - from its technical framework to its real-world application to intriguing viewpoints by various scholars.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://101blockchains.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Trying-to-explain-blockchain-meme.jpg" alt="Blockchain Memes exist"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, we don’t want to come off as experts on the field, however we have delved into the works with blockchain and seen some of its practical uses. Don’t worry nothing in the guide is crazy complicated, and everything should only bring practical value to how you use and see this technology in the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/Xtg9ygGsjvouF7vZ1w/giphy.gif?cid=790b76117a068db83a4ea40cd3a34f034bb6d67e9ae86b43&rid=giphy.gif" alt="Blockchain Memes exist"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So let’s dive in.
