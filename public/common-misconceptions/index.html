You probably heard them in separate contexts, but like a majority of people, you lumped them into a single category, and there is a very good reason for that: the majority of the modern use of <strong>blockchain</strong> technology has been for financial transactions (with cryptocurrencies).<a id="more"></a></p><p>Despite this, Bitcoin and blockchain are related, but very separate. In general, the word blockchain is a macro-level classification of a series of blocks that are linked together cryptographically. Bitcoin, however, is a cryptocurrency that is powered by a blockchain that stores transactions. That being said, unless your friend’s startup is in the financial technology space, it is probably not using Bitcoin itself. However, they may be using a <strong>blockchain</strong>, as blockchains have applications that are well-beyond the space of finance.</p><p><strong>Useful Properties of Blockchains</strong></p><p>Distributed sources that can be read from and written to have long been used in computer systems (for example, databases are ubiquitous) — however, the properties of blockchains can be exploited to act similarly to databases, but have extra features. For example, the fact that blockchains inherently do not support the removal of blocks make them very powerful for keeping track of accountability. One place in which accountability is very important is a supply chain, where many different entities need to communicate in order to start with raw supplies in one part of the world and end up with a complete product in another part of the world. Because blockchains are inherently very accountable and allow for multiple people to write to them, they could be applied widely in the field.</p><p><strong>Secure…but public</strong></p><p>Even though blockchains are powerful storage systems, there is one thing that they are definitely not — private. Because all validators on a blockchain must agree on new blocks that are being placed, and because anyone can read from the blockchain, the data stored in blocks must be secured. That means that some data, such as health records, can’t easily be stored.</p></div></article></div></main><footer><div class="paginator"><a class="prev" href="../smart-contracts/">PREV</a><a class="next" href="../storage-layer/">NEXT</a></div><div class="copyright"><p>Made with ♡ by the CS 58N class at Stanford</p><p>© 2020 Adam Siwiec and Co.</p></div></footer></div><script async src="//cdn.bootcss.com/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML" integrity="sha384-crwIf/BuaWM9rM65iM+dWFldgQ1Un8jWZMuh3puxb8TOY9+linwLoI7ZHZT+aekW" crossorigin="anonymous"></script></body></html>
